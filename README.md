# A Cognitive Load Theory Approach to Differentiating Human and AI Text

This repository contains the code used to detect whether academic texts are AI-generated, based on linguistic features grounded in Cognitive Load Theory.

# Overview of the script

The script analyzes textual features such as syntactic complexity, lexical variety as cognitive load indicators, and applies machine learning techniques to classify texts as either human-written or AI-generated.

# Requirements

1. Language: Python (any versions of python above 3.11)

2. Libraries
  - `os`
  - `random`
  - `json`
  - `re`
  - `typing`
  - `nltk`, `nltk.tokenize`, `punkt`
  - `pandas`
  - `spacy`
  - `collections.defaultdict`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `seaborn`

# How to use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Run the Python scripts.
4. As the data is under academic liscece and has restrictions, they are not openly published here. the details can be seen on the website of COCA FULL-TEXT dataset: https://www.corpusdata.org/intro.asp. however, a sample less than the restricted word count is available from the author upon reasonable request and with the permission of Xiamen University (XMU). other derived data in this study, such as scripts, resulting output (including output for metrics that was subsequently used as training data for classification model) will be shared on this webpage. These resources enable full replication of the reported analyses given appropriate access to COCA.
